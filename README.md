## Update: 28-NOV-24
Hey folks, wanted to let you know that development on this framework will be paused while I take a break from FFXI.

# Smart.LAC

### Git installation
Requirements:
- a git client like Git for Windows or the `git` package for your linux distro.
- a basic understanding of how to navigate using the command line

Steps:
1. Find your way to your LuAshitacast config folder (e.g. `C:/Ashita/config/addons/luashitacast`)

3. You're done.
