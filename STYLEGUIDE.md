This repo uses a custom code style. 

* Lines do not end with a semicolon
* Use Tabs for indentation
* Opening Brackets do not get their own line
* Each closing bracket should have its own line
* A closing parenthesis immediately after a closing bracket should be on the same line as the bracket
* Indent nested scopes with 1 tab
* When possible, make lines shorter than 80 characters
* Separate functions and methods with 1 newline
* Use unix style (LF) line endings
* When breaking up large boolean operations, break up long lines by adding a new line *before* the boolean operator
* indent multiline boolean operations with tabs until they (mostly) match the line above
* When creating a class, define the table and add methods using the : operator
* Any new classes must include a <name>.h.lua file that defines the types createds
