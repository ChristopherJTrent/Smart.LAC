## Note for Horizon and other private server players
Private server support is not provided. Do not post issues discovered on a private server unless you can reproduce them on an official Square-Enix server running the current retail version of FFXI. You are expected to ensure that Horizon mode is not enabled in your Luashitacast configuration before attempting to use this framework. Horizon mode causes problems.

## Note for Pet job players (DRG, SMN, BST)
Pet action support hasn't been added yet. please check [This Issue](https://github.com/ChristopherJTrent/Smart.LAC/issues/33) for updates.
