# Smart.LAC
A framework for LuAshitacast that allows for declarative use of LuAshitacast

## Setup
Take a look at the [Repo Wiki](https://github.com/ChristopherJTrent/Smart.LAC/wiki) for more information.

## Development
Outside of the standard usage of LuAshitacast, we also use Unit Tests for Smart.LAC.
To run the tests, use `runTests.sh` or `runTests.bat`. (windows support is experimental and untested)
This requires a local lua install, and a global installation of `luaunit` (recommended: use LuaRocks)
